# World Engine 2.0 — verified progress

Date: 2026-10-29. Development branch: `feature/world-engine-v2`.

## M0 / M1

- Parent: `feature/diplomacy-v1`. Existing `PlanetSurfaceGenerator` v1 source left unchanged.
- New `WorldSeedChannels` provides stable, independently derived 64-bit layer seeds.
- New `PlanetRegionGrid` provides hierarchical streaming addresses; coordinates remain continuous and are not tied to atlas pixel size.
- New `PlanetSurfaceV2` defines a separate version and a deterministic terrain sampling entry point. Its initial elevation is intentionally delegated to v1. **This is not new geology, erosion, or climate yet.**
- New `PlanetSurfaceV2Test` checks v1 equivalence, adjacent edges, parent/child alignment, seed channels, invalid inputs, and the longitude seam.
- Full baseline CI passed at commit `55d968a2494edf28681aa3d5d1c77818c9089d68`: https://github.com/Yusuf-cm/wild-deck/actions/runs/40877957640 . Includes Maven tests, world demo, browser-save checks, atlas export, Chromium atlas verification.

## M3 geometry prototype (partial)

- New `LocalTerrainMesh` generates a local triangle heightfield using authoritative planet samples and immutable vertex arrays.
- New `LocalTerrainMeshTest` checks triangle counts, indices, shared tile boundaries, parent/child samples, immutability and input limits.
- **Pending:** CI result for commit `fe41a6b3cbf6fca47ec8762dfabc7f801b616525`: https://github.com/Yusuf-cm/wild-deck/actions/runs/40878147894 .
- **Not yet implemented:** renderer, true fine-scale terrain, stitched different-LOD edge topology, caves, climate, hydrology, erosion, finite deposits, mutable terrain, card interactions on the planet, persistent world modifications, or photorealistic imagery.

## Next gated work

1. Obtain green CI for local terrain meshes; repair any failures.
2. Implement independently seeded high-frequency local detail with exact boundary and parent/child consistency, retaining v1 macro terrain.
3. Add geology and drainage validation before promoting M2.
4. Create a browser 3D viewer only after stable geometry and performance benchmarks.
5. Integrate materials, persistence, and Wild Deck card actions incrementally; do not introduce another match engine.

## Safety

No production deployment, Render billing change, or paid database modifications. CI runs are ordinary repository test workflows.
